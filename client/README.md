# Frontend for Marketing Website
The frontend was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Your Task
Create a new website that highlights the great features of the product and provides in-depth information about each 
feature. The pages should include:
- Homepage with photograph and high level overview
- Feature pages linked from homepage with more details
- Create a landing page so users can sign up for more information.
- Include a “Call to Action” link at the bottom of every page on the website except for the contact page itself that links to the contact page
